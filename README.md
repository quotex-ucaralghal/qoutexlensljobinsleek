## The Percent Rule

1.  Trade a fixed percentage of your account balance per trade (e.g.,
    1-5%).
2.  This ensures consistent trade sizes, eliminates guesswork, and
    prevents emotional decision-making.
3.  As your account grows, the trade size increases, allowing for
    potential profit growth.

## Other Money Management Strategies

-   **Fixed Amount Rule:** Trade a predetermined amount per trade,
    regardless of account balance.
-   **Martingale Strategy:** Double the trade size after each loss to
    recover losses (high-risk strategy).
-   **Fibonacci Rule:** Use Fibonacci ratios to determine risk-to-reward
    ratios and trade sizes.

## Systems and Risk Management

-   Set personal trading rules (e.g., trend trading, trade frequency).
-   Avoid setting monetary profit goals, as they can lead to emotional
    trading.
-   Use a risk calculator to determine the maximum risk exposure per
    trade based on your risk tolerance.
